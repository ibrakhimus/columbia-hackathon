This is the backend for the Columbia DevFest hackathon.

`venv` has been setup as `backend` - make sure to set that as your python interpreter
    it's been .gitignored due to file size

# `venv` setup
- path into the backend dir
- create `venv` with this command `python3 -m venv backend`
- activate `venv` with `source backend/bin/activate`
    - must be within `backend` dir (yes there's two folders named `backend` - my bad)
- incase the VSC IDE doesn't pick up the interpreter, set the interpreter as the path 
    - path: `backend/backend/bin/python3.11`
    - python version might be different if you have a different python set up
